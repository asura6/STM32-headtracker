This project is a 9 degrees of freedom headtracker made using a STM32
microcontroller, a MPU-9250 MEMS-device and the open source Madgwick
sensor-fusion algorithm.

The MCU directory contain microcontroller relevant-code. The analysis directory
contain a directory which include analysis software which plots the sensor
output by intercepting raw HID-communication data through the USB protocol.

This project is build using gcc and makefiles.

More details will follow.
